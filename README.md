## General info
Our project is a quiz that tests the knowledge of the Star Wars universe. This is a browser based web application, so no installation is required. 

## Features
-	The main page contains the rules of the game and shows a sample photo and answers to a question relevant to People category.
-	Before each game, you are taken to the settings, where you choose the category (next to it is an example photo), speed and mode of your game. Additionally, if you chose to fight against the computer, you have to select the difficulty level.
-	Once the game starts, the timer starts counting down, and at the bottom of the screen the lightsaber shows how much time is left. After selecting the answer, it is shown for a second whether the answer was right or wrong. Then the question is changed to the next one and so until the end of time.
-	After finishing the game, the player's score is summed up and if the player writes his name, it will appear in the overall ranking of the players.
-	The application is responsive, so there is an option to display it on tablets and phones.
